Tired of the text on the default 404 pages? Change the text of the default WordPress 404 pages or, as soon as we start adding them, just choose one of our seasonal, custom designed or industry-related 404 pages for your WordPress website.

== Description ==

404 Page Editor is a convenient way to use custom text for the default 404 page for your WordPress website. We will add more custom designed, seasonal or industry-related 404 pages and please feel free to use any of those and change the text as you please.

This is the very first release and we will be adding more templates and features as we go.

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots at the moment.

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' Plugin Dashboard
2. Click on 'Upload Plugin'
3. Select '404-Page-Editor.zip' from your computer
4. Click Install Now
5. After Installation, click on Activate, to activate the plugin
6. You will now find '404 Page Editor' in your Settings Menu.

== How does it work? ==

1. 404 Page Editor duplicates your current 404.php page to wp-content/uploads/404-page-editor/
2. Then copies your current 404 page to 404_backup.php in that same wp-content/uploads/404-page-editor/ folder.
3. You are then free to change the text of a default WordPress 404 page.

== Word of warning ==

1. Should you delete the 404 Page Editor plugin, links to any custom 404 page designs will be removed and you will still be able to use the default 404 page that existed before installing 404 Page Editor.
